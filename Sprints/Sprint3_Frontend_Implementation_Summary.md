## ðŸ§ª Testing Notes

The implementation has been built and compiles successfully. The following should be tested:

1. News fetch â†’ Generate Posts button appears
2. Click Generate Posts â†’ Navigate to posts page
3. Posts generation loading state
4. Posts display correctly with character counts
5. Copy functionality works
6. Error handling for API failures
7. Navigation back to news page
