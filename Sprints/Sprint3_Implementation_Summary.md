# Sprint 3 Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. **Backend Database Model**
- Created `GeneratedPost` model in `backend/app/models/generated_post.py`
- Added relationship to Session model
- Supports both LinkedIn and X post types with edit tracking

### 2. **LangGraph State Management**
- Created `PostState` in `backend/app/langgraph/state/post_state.py`
- Handles post generation workflow state
- Tracks processing steps and errors

### 3. **Post Generation Nodes**
- **LinkedIn Post Node** (`backend/app/langgraph/nodes/linkedin_post_node.py`)
  - Dynamic content adjustment based on article count (3-12 articles)
  - 3000 character limit enforcement
  - Professional formatting with headlines, summaries, and CTAs
  - Hashtag extraction

- **X Post Node** (`backend/app/langgraph/nodes/x_post_node.py`)
  - Concise 250-character posts
  - TinyURL integration for link shortening
  - Smart hashtag generation based on topic
  - Intelligent truncation to preserve hashtags

- **Save Posts Node** (`backend/app/langgraph/nodes/save_posts_node.py`)
  - Saves generated posts to database
  - Links posts to session and news workflow

### 4. **Post Generation Workflow**
- Created `PostWorkflow` in `backend/app/langgraph/workflows/post_workflow.py`
- Parallel processing of LinkedIn and X posts for efficiency
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 5. **API Endpoints**
- Created comprehensive REST API in `backend/app/api/routes/posts.py`:
  - `POST /api/posts/generate` - Generate posts from articles
  - `PUT /api/posts/{post_id}` - Update/edit a post
  - `GET /api/posts/{post_id}` - Get a specific post
  - `GET /api/posts/session/{session_id}` - Get all posts for a session
  - `DELETE /api/posts/{post_id}` - Delete a post

### 6. **Configuration Updates**
- Added `TINYURL_API_KEY` to environment configuration
- Updated `backend/.env.example` with new key
- Added `aiohttp` dependency for URL shortening

### 7. **Shared Types**
- Updated `shared/src/types.ts` with:
  - `PostGenerationRequest`
  - `PostGenerationResponse`
  - `GeneratedPost`

## ðŸš€ Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration**: The `generated_posts` table will be created automatically when the backend is deployed to Render, as the `main.py` file runs migrations on startup.

2. **Environment Variables**: Add `TINYURL_API_KEY` to your Render environment variables if you want URL shortening functionality.

3. **Dependencies**: The updated `requirements.txt` includes `aiohttp==3.9.1` for URL shortening.

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps for Frontend

The backend is now ready to generate LinkedIn and X posts. The frontend needs to:

1. **Create Post Generation Page**
   - Add a button on NewsResults to "Generate Posts"
   - Pass selected articles to post generation endpoint

2. **Post Preview Components**
   - LinkedIn post preview with formatting
   - X post preview with character count
   - Visual indicators for character limits

3. **Post Editor Components**
   - Rich text editor for LinkedIn
   - Plain text editor for X
   - Real-time character counting
   - Save functionality using PUT endpoint

4. **Navigation**
   - Add route for `/posts` page
   - Link from news results to post generation

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Backend

Once deployed, you can test the post generation API:

```bash
# Generate posts from news articles
curl -X POST https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/posts/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "articles": [...],
    "topic": "AI",
    "llmModel": "claude-3-5-sonnet",
    "sessionId": "your-session-id",
    "newsWorkflowId": "workflow-id"
  }'

# Update a post
curl -X PUT https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/posts/{post_id} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Updated post content"
  }'

# Get posts for a session
curl https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/posts/session/{session_id}
```

## âœ… Sprint 3 Backend Complete!

The backend implementation for Sprint 3 is now complete. All post generation functionality is ready to be deployed and integrated with the frontend.
