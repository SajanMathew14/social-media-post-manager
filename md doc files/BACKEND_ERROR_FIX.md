# Backend Error Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary

The backend was returning a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to generate posts via the `/api/posts/generate` endpoint. The root cause was incorrect parameter names when initializing LLM clients in the post generation nodes.

## Errors Fixed

1. **News Fetch (200 OK)** - Already working correctly
2. **Post Generation (500 Error)** - Fixed by aligning LLM initialization with working nodes

## Root Cause Identified

The post generation nodes (LinkedIn and X) were using different parameter names for API keys compared to the working summarize_content_node:
- **Incorrect**: `anthropic_api_key`, `openai_api_key`
- **Correct**: `api_key` (for both Anthropic and OpenAI)

This prevented the nodes from properly initializing even though the API keys were correctly set in Render's environment variables.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed LLM Client Initialization

**File: `backend/app/langgraph/nodes/linkedin_post_node.py`**
- Changed `anthropic_api_key=` to `api_key=` for ChatAnthropic
- Changed `openai_api_key=` to `api_key=` for ChatOpenAI
- Kept `google_api_key=` as is (correct for ChatGoogleGenerativeAI)

**File: `backend/app/langgraph/nodes/x_post_node.py`**
- Same parameter name fixes as LinkedIn node

### 2. Removed Local .env Override

**File: `backend/.env`**
- Deleted the local .env file that had empty API keys
- This ensures Render's environment variables are used directly

### 3. Cleaned Up Unnecessary Validation

**File: `backend/app/api/routes/posts.py`**
- Removed the API key validation check that was added
- The nodes themselves handle missing providers appropriately

## How It Works Now

1. The application uses environment variables from Render (or local .env if present)
2. All LLM nodes now use consistent parameter names for initialization
3. The summarize_content_node (used in news fetch) and post generation nodes now work identically

## Verification

The fix ensures that:
- API keys stored in Render's environment variables are properly used
- Post generation works with the same LLM configuration as news summarization
- No local configuration overrides the production settings

## Key Takeaway

When using LangChain's LLM clients, ensure parameter names match the library's expectations:
- ChatAnthropic uses `api_key=`
- ChatOpenAI uses `api_key=`
- ChatGoogleGenerativeAI uses `google_api_key=`

This consistency across all nodes ensures proper initialization regardless of where the environment variables are set.
