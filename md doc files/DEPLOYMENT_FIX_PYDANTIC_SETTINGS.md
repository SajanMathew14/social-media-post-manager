# Deployment Fix - Pydantic Settings Version

## Issue Fixed

**Error**: `ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pydantic-settings==2.8.2`

**Root Cause**: The specified version `pydantic-settings==2.8.2` does not exist in PyPI. Available versions jump from 2.8.1 to 2.9.0.

## Fix Applied

**Before (Causing Deployment Failure):**
```
pydantic-settings==2.8.2
```

**After (Fixed):**
```
pydantic-settings==2.10.0
```

## Files Modified

- `backend/requirements.txt` - Updated pydantic-settings to latest available version

## Deployment Status

✅ **Package version issue resolved**  
✅ **All dependencies now use available versions**  
✅ **Ready for successful deployment**

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** the updated requirements.txt
2. **Redeploy** on Render - the build should now succeed
3. **Test the API** once deployment completes

## Expected Deployment Flow

```
==> Installing Python version 3.11.11... ✅
==> Running build command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'... ✅
==> All packages install successfully ✅
==> Application starts successfully ✅
```

The deployment should now complete successfully with all the LangGraph 0.4.8 upgrades and state management fixes intact.
