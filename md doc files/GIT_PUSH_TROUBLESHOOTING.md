# Git Push 403 Error Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem Summary
You're experiencing a persistent HTTP 403 error when trying to push to your GitHub repository, despite having a valid Personal Access Token.

## What We've Tried
1. ✅ Cleared old credentials from macOS keychain
2. ✅ Verified new token is valid and has repository permissions
3. ✅ Configured Git credential storage
4. ✅ Removed conflicting SSL and credential configurations
5. ✅ Attempted multiple authentication methods

## Current Status
- **Token**: `[REDACTED FOR SECURITY]` (valid, full repo access)
- **Repository**: `SajanMathew14/social-media-post-manager` (accessible via API)
- **Local commits**: 2 commits ahead of origin/main
- **Error**: HTTP 403 during push operation

## Recommended Solutions (in order of priority)

### 1. Check Token Scopes on GitHub
Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Verify your token has these scopes:
  - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
  - ✅ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
  - ✅ `write:packages` (if using GitHub Packages)

### 2. Try GitHub Desktop
Download GitHub Desktop and try pushing through the GUI:
- Often handles authentication differently than command line
- May bypass the specific 403 issue you're encountering

### 3. Create a Fresh Token
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Delete the current token
3. Generate a new token with ALL repository scopes
4. Update your credentials file: `~/.git-credentials`

### 4. Alternative Push Methods

#### Method A: Direct URL Push
```bash
git push https://YOUR_NEW_TOKEN@github.com/SajanMathew14/social-media-post-manager.git main
```

#### Method B: Temporary Remote
```bash
git remote add temp https://YOUR_NEW_TOKEN@github.com/SajanMathew14/social-media-post-manager.git
git push temp main
git remote remove temp
```

### 5. Manual Upload (Last Resort)
1. Create a new branch on GitHub web interface
2. Upload changed files manually
3. Create a pull request and merge

## Current Git Configuration
```
user.name=Sajan Mathew
user.email=sajan.mathew@piramal.com
credential.helper=store
remote.origin.url=https://github.com/SajanMathew14/social-media-post-manager.git
```

## Files to Push
You have 2 local commits that need to be pushed to the remote repository.

## Next Steps
1. Try creating a new token with full scopes
2. If that fails, use GitHub Desktop
3. Contact GitHub Support if the issue persists

## Notes
- The token is valid for API access but fails during Git push operations
- This suggests a GitHub server-side issue or specific push permission problem
- The error occurs during the final push phase, not authentication
