# Render Deployment TrustedHost Middleware Fix

## Problem
The FastAPI application was failing on Render with the error:
```
AssertionError: Domain wildcard patterns must be like '*.example.com'.
```

This occurred because the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` configuration was being used for both CORS middleware and TrustedHost middleware, but they have incompatible format requirements.

## Root Cause
1. **CORS middleware** expects full URLs with protocols (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
2. **TrustedHost middleware** expects domain names only, without protocols (e.g., `localhost`)
3. The configuration had `https://*.onrender.com` (with protocol) and a standalone `*` wildcard, both of which are invalid for TrustedHost middleware

## Solution
Separated the configuration into two distinct settings:

### 1. Updated `backend/app/core/config.py`:
```python
# CORS Origins (full URLs with protocols)
CORS_ORIGINS: List[str] = ["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000", "https://*.onrender.com"]

# Trusted Hosts (domain names only, no protocols)
TRUSTED_HOSTS: List[str] = ["localhost", "127.0.0.1", "*.onrender.com"]
```

### 2. Updated `backend/app/main.py`:
```python
# Add middleware
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=settings.CORS_ORIGINS,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

app.add_middleware(
    TrustedHostMiddleware,
    allowed_hosts=settings.TRUSTED_HOSTS
)
```

### 3. Updated `backend/.env.example`:
```
# CORS Origins (full URLs with protocols)
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000,https://*.onrender.com
# Trusted Hosts (domain names only, no protocols)
TRUSTED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,*.onrender.com
```

## Verification
Created `backend/test_config.py` to validate the configuration:
- Ensures CORS origins have protocols
- Ensures trusted hosts don't have protocols
- Checks for invalid standalone wildcards

## Key Takeaways
1. Always separate CORS origins from trusted hosts when using both middlewares
2. CORS origins need full URLs with protocols
3. Trusted hosts need domain names only (no protocols)
4. Standalone `*` wildcard is not allowed in TrustedHost middleware
5. Domain wildcards must be in the format `*.domain.com`
